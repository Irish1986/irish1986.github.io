### Ski Uphill

I bought myself some nice touring ski couple of years ago.  Thinking I would get into ski mountaineering eventually coming from a climbing & alpine background I spend 2 years skiing just to learn the basic.  Finally, I had all the basic skill and was good enough to try touring.  I never had toured before and was planning to go in a smaller resort before in order to get familiar with my gears.  So my 1st touring gear are [2013 Atomic Drift (173cm)](https://www.evo.com/outlet/skis/atomic-drifter-2013), slightly too short for me but short ski are good for beginner, with [Tyrolia Adrenalin 13](https://www.evo.com/outlet/alpine-touring-ski-bindings/tyrolia-adrenalin-13-long), because I am fat so no tech pins for me and new [Dalbello V.I.R.U.S. Tour ID](https://www.evo.com/outlet/ski-boots/dalbello-virus-tour-id-alpine-touring).

### The Trails

Long story short and bad weather, I ended up in Mont Tremblant on the south side.  Going up hill via the [Johannsen](https://vicomap-cdn.resorts-interactive.com/map/1801) was gruesome since I wasn't in really good shape.  2018 was hard for me and I have gain about 20-35 pounds this year.  It took me about 3.5 hours to ski uphill and by the time I summitted, I was not having that much fun.  I took a short break at the top and decided on taking Beauvallon run's to go down.  My legs were tired and I was exhausted but each turn was earn.  Although the day was hard and it was a fun learning experience.

### Lesson Learn

* I am too fat, time to get in shape.
* I had way too many layer, ski uphill is just like running.
* My setup is very heavy and carried to much gear in my pack.
* It was a great adventure and I will enjoy touring a lot.
* I should start slow and finish strong (not the other way around).
