## Express Tour

Since I was in a car accident earlier this year, I do not own a car anymore.  I had plan several outing with [Express Tour](https://www.expresstours.ca/) using the bus shuttle service as well as the good rates they offer for day skiing.  The pick up point in Montreal is metro Cremazie around 6:15 so I took the metro around 5:45 giving myself so time.  Luckily I didn't had to drive so I could rest in the bus until the border and we reach Jay Peak half an hour later.

## Big Jay

Jay Peak on a Monday morning in January is very calm.  Our little bus of Quebecers (~35 people) had the whole mountain to ourselves.  It was a great day overall.  The lift was a bit

## Lesson Learn

* I am too fat, time to get in shape.
* I had way too many layer, ski uphill is just like running.
* My setup is very heavy and carried to much gear in my pack.
* It was a great adventure and I will enjoy touring a lot.
* I should start slow and finish strong (not the other way around).
