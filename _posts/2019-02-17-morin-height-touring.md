## Skimo
I have been out touring couple of times now and my friend Guillaume loved his experience at [Groski Fest]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2019-01-26-mont-avalanche-grosskifest %}) therefore he did the sensible thing.  He bought himself a whole lot of gear !  We decided to try Morin Height' skin track this time.

I found this Strava segment and wanted to push myself a bit with Guillaume since he has a better cardio than I do.  I got into ski touring in the hope to get in better shape.  So today was a Skimo day, fast ascent and transition trying to lap as much as possible the mountain.

I didn't slept well the night before therefore after couple of laps I was completely exhausted.  I was done after half a day and went home to sleep and rest.
