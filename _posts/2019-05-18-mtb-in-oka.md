My lovely GF and I went to Oka for a quick mountain biking morning session.  It was our first time going MTB-ing together and we were both very happy about it.  It had been rainy in the past few weeks and we were working very hard on various personal projects therefore we couldn't be happier to go play outside.

## Bike situation

I riding a fairly old Trek 4300 Alpha which I bought for roughly 200$ last year with various upgrade that I had made from others bike parts that were laying around.  I am still waiting for my new drivetrain (XT M8000 11-46) and my smallest front chain ring is a 34T.  On top of that my crankset keeps falling apart because of a cheap bolt that just doesn't work.  In a nutshell, my bike is not in good condition and will be my limitation.

My GF is riding a much better DUAL SUSPENSION Ghost 27.5.  It is well equipped yet she refuse my help to take a quick look at the general condition of her bike.  The rear derailleur was out of alignment and the cable a mess, she couldn't shift and was stuck on the small cog the whole morning.

We were both riding good bike that weren't ready for the trail.
