### Finally time to rest
My lovely partner in climb and I are going on our summer vacation.  Earlier this summer, I [switched job]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2019-07-21-keene-climbing %}) and we planned for late autumn timeframe to go on a trip in the USA.  Chantale was overworked and felt really terrible therefore she took an extra week ahead to rest and catch on some sleep.  On my end, I did had a terrible 2019 year and going on this break with Chantale was perfect.

### Trip planning

We have 8 to 10 days ahead of us and we planned to explore the Northeast of the USA.  Although I have a very specific itinerary, Chantale is more a free mind and wants to go with the flow.  Therefore we will end up mountain biking in Burke for certain and at some point in time in the Gunks rock climbing.

### Expedition truck is ready

We borrowed my dad's truck for the trip so we would have a safe place to leave of mountain bike and other gear will going away.  Originally, we taught it could also have been a place to sleep if the condition worsen but it just too small with both bike and a week's worth of gear.
