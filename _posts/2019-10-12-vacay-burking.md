### Long weekend, long delay
Finally, the truck is packed and we are off.  But first we have several hours worth or music ahead of us to cross the border and reach Vermont.  Unfortunately, this is the Canadian Thanksgiving long weekend which means patience at the border.  Maybe we should had left earlier (as I wanted) but we are on vacation so we are in no rush anyway.

### Kingdom Trail in Burke
It my first time at [Kingdom Trail](https://www.kingdomtrails.org/) in Burke.  I have heard a lots of good about this place and watch  [The Singletrack Sampler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2y5tfaA-H-A&t=624s) visited this place.  We asked for help and recommendation at the visitor center whom they provided us with maps and a good idea of where and what to do.

The trails system is awesome !!!  Although I am still a new rider, I was told the grade are a bit sandbagged here.  It is true but good for our ego.  After couple of hours riding we found a nice skills park and stopped for a quick coffee.

### First camp
I am a planner, Chantale is a free spirit.  We knew that Burke was full of Quebecers because of the long week (and probably the last one for a lot of rider).  So we found a primitive camping in [Barton](https://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/14629532?source_impression_id=p3_1577474332_7k6wbt%2BmyxzA5fvB) about 30 minutes from the main trails.  The spot was okay although no water and a bit difficult to find.  I would go back since it was cheap and not that far away from the main trails.
