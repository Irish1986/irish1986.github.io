### Kingdom Trail in Burke
Our second day biking in Burke and we felt ready for a bigger adventure.  Yesterday, we stayed around the easier section of the trails and went uphill on a steep climb full of switch backs.  Today we planned on a longer ride and explore the furthest section of the trails.  Everything was perfect including some nice skinnies and a few jumps over structures.  Chantale is terrified of skinnies for her life so fun time in Burke !

Since I enjoyed the coffee break so much we opted out for a beer and quick coffee with snacks.  This place is mountain bike Paradis in the Northeast.

### New plan, new location
We got into a little travel fight (it wouldn't be vacation otherwise) and we ended changing plan.  Tomorrow, we shall go sport climbing in Rumney and we will be sleeping [DAcres](https://www.dacres.org/).  I have been here a few years ago with my previous climbing partner Andy.  I knew the place and would be arriving fairly late.  We had a nice full moon to help us setup our tent site.
