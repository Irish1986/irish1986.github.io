### Back in Rumney
I came to Rumney a few years ago with my previous climbing partner Andy.  Back then, I wasn't super confident leading and my climbing performance were sub-optimal.  Yet I knew the spot well enough so we hiked up to Jimmy Cliff which I recalled was way closer.  We went past all the huge overhanging wall with the super hard climb that I will never even think to attempt in my whole life.

### Easy climb but fun time
My partner in climb and I both enjoy easy multi-pitch climb and although Rumney is known for some of the hardest sport climb in the Northeast there are plenty or easy and fun climb.  I had climb on Jimmy Wall last time but I didn't explore other area.  We continue to hike up to the Crow's Nest and enjoyed Pee Wee's Big Adventure trad climb.  Really nice route although a bit short.
