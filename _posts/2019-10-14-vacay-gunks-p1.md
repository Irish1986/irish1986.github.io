### Getting there
We slept in Albany and left before 6 o'clock that morning heading toward New Paltz.  Visiting the Gunks had been on my radar for over a decades and finally I was getting there with my lovely partner in climb.

### The Trapps
We hiked up to the Trapps thinking to climb in the Uberfall area yet I was a bit nervous about the "gunks grade" system which everyone agrees 5.5 in the Gunks feels like 5.8 elsewhere.  So nervously, I started climbing Yale and we did Penn which were next to each other.  We finish climbing No Picnic but I was in a bad mood.  We took the rest of the day to rest, eat and enjoy time together.  In retrospective, I was a bit overwhelm with the Gunks and nervous about being the only one leading.
