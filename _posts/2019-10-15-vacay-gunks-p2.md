### Adventure Time !!!
After a good night of sleep and some time talking with Chantale, we brushed off our travel fight and putted that being us.  We focused on our trip and what we were here to do, climb some of the best rock in North America !!!  The day before we hiked pass some of the most popular classic which were under assault by several group.  So today would be our day to climb them

### Rhododendron & Laurel !!!
Rhododendron is this classic single pitch crack, it features plenty of good protection, descent size jugs and some awesome fingers and hand jams.  I am always nervous trad climbing even in low grade but being in the Gunks it felt like I was already climbing several grades above my usual.  This was very mental because the climb is not that hard, I had a few nice "zen moments" about half way where the crux of the route is, focusing on my breathing and task at hand.  Upon reaching the top, I setup a top rope for Chantale so she could try it.

Coming down, I climb the Dirty Chimney which is an easy 5.0 climb to setup an anchor for Laurel, another classic although much harder climb, is about 10-15 feet of Rhodo.  Couple of tough move to get off the ground followed by a nice long crack with well place rest.  Great climb !  I am writing this about 3 months after the fact some I don't recall what other climb we did that day.

Edit: We did climb the Northern Pillar since it was the first route ever climb in the Gunks.  It gave us a good adventure on slightly expose pitches.  It was just next to Madame G which is for certain on my tick list for next year.

### Mohonk Campground
One of the reason why we opted for autumn vacation was to avoid the massive crowd the Gunks attracts.  We had the whole campground to ourselves, got some guac on sale, big bag of chips and played some cribbage.
