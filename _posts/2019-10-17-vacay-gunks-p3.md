### Motel sleeping
After couple of days, the warm weather is weltering away and now we have full autumn temperature.  It is getting colder and yesterday's rain made everything wet.  So we did some exploring and hiking to find our next project.  Since Chantale only led on trad gear once and everything is still a bit wet, we use the opportunity to have her practices some placements.  Under the Uberfall roof near Horseman, we found a large number of crack.  She would walk couple of feet, make a gear placement and after 20 to 30 feet away I would come and join her.  She didn't enjoy my editorial opinion but she understood it was constructive criticisms.

### Boston and Ken's Crack
The weather is still not looking good with lots of cloud so we tried to setup an anchor on Boston.  Chantale couldn't get to the top and had a lot of difficulty climbing the large offwidth.  I gave it a try and no way this is 5.5 YDS, people in the Gunks are nuts !!!  As I was about to move on Ken's crack some thunders roar and light rain started so we went back to camp for a cold evening.
