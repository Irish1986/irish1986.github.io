### Last day in the Gunks
We left Montreal 9 days ago, on our first couple adventure/vacation together.  It has been a fun and challenging adventure.  Three things to test your relation: home improvement, camping and vacation.  Hopefully, we did the first two earlier in the summer and survive with a few scratch the third item on the list.

### Betty
We scouted Betty couple of days ago, a massive crack first climb by Betty.  We kept this for last to end with a Bang !!!  This route is a must do.  The first pitch, followed by dihedral with a roof traverse and the last pitch with a lots of good exposure.  Great climb !!!

We went back to the truck and drove to Montreal.  Awesome vacation with my beautiful partner in climb !
