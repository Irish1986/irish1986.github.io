## Back in Oka

We did spent a [good amount]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2019-05-18-mtb-in-oka %}) of time in [Oka]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2019-08-11-mtb-in-oka %}) this [summer]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2019-08-03-mtb-in-oka %}).  At this point we did pretty much all the trails that we could (within our reach and capabilities).  We got lost a bit and tried to explore the map but after couple of hours we had enough fun.

### Little flesh wound

Autumn means leaves and rain and Oka is full exposed tree roots... So I felt off my bike and after taking a good look at it... It's not pretty.  Be careful riding in this time of year and run low pressure.
