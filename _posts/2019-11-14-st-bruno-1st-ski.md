### Let's go already !

Snow dump earlier this week, took four our of flex time from work... We went skiing in St-Bruno.  Horrible conditions but snow is snow !  I used my Atomic Drifter since they are now my old ski and I do not mind a few more scratches on them.  This season will be awesome and we can not be happier.
