### Four open runs and two lifts

Wait a minute St-Sauveur... When your website said four open runs and two lift, I did not expected you to count the kid magic carpet and 20 feet flat run part of those... So we were about 250 people for just once lift.  It was not that bad between 7 to 10 minutes wait on the lift.  We did 5 or 6 runs and join Chantale's parent to tell them a beautiful news.

### We are expecting

So long story short, Chantale is pregnant.  We are super happy and I could not ask for a better partner in climb.  Therefore we will front load our ski season as much as possible before Chantale can not safety ski (or see her feet).  We have known since [our last mountain bike day in Oka]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2019-10-26-last-time-oka %}) couple of weeks ago.  So no huge adventure into the wild freezing backcountry for us this winter, just small casual days.
