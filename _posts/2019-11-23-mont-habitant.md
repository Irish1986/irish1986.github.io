### Mont Habitant

Another day with very early snow condition, Mont Habitant had just 2 runs open and we tried to enjoy has much as possible what was available to us.  We did about 6-7 runs and went home.  We stopped by Chantale's parent cottage for afternoon lunch and a long hike.  Boo was really happy about it !
