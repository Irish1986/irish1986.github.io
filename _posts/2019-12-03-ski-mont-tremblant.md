### The case of missing ticket

Last winter, Chantale and myself went [skiing in Tremblant]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2019-03-29-touring-tremblant-northside %}) with X-Mas gift ticket.  We all know how that day ended up.  During the summer, I did manage to find the missing ticket and we had to use them before Dec 6th 2019 therefore we had to go.

We won't be chair skiing often in Tremblant since it so freaking expansive therefore we have to maximize those ticket.  The North side was finally open but snow condition are really in yet so only half was accessible.

After a few runs, Chantale needed a break to rest and I venture into more difficult runs my new Scrapper performed well and deeper snow will be awesome with them.
