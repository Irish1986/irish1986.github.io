### Maximizing our MaNeige Duo ski pass

As said in couple of post earlier, we got a [MaNeige Duo](https://boutique.maneige.ski/en/mobilski-duo.html) ski pass.  So far this is our 7th outing of the year.  Therefore, we don't really care for half day and the number of runs we get in a day.  [Ski Canada states](https://www.skicanada.org/about-us/quick-facts/) that Canadian skiers and snowboarders ski or snowboard an average of 7.5 days per year therefore our next trip will means our ski pass return on investment is almost achieve.  Although we do ski a lot more than the average Canadian.

### Another pair in the Quiver

[My Quiver]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2019-09-13-ski-gear-2020 %}) keeps expending this year.  A friend of mine was selling Rossignol Sin 7 with broken G3 Ion 12 binding and the price was just too good, just the binding worth over 600$.  So my quiver expanded by another pair.  Since I am most likely going to use my Sin7 out of bound, breaking them in bound was the best option.

The main chair lift was crowded especially the new gondola so we did a few lap on the kid's side and we used the secondary lift which although slower was better than waiting.  Earlier condition, few icy runs and a thin base give us a good half day but given the wait at the base of the lift we would not had been happy to pay 72$ each.
