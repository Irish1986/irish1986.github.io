### Back in a kayak

So I did a bit of kayaking before starting to rock climb.  I never got the good enough to do a proper kayak roll but Chantale is truly a great kayaker.  She did several huge, multiday kayak adventure include the whole freaking Grand Canyon !!!  She is amazing.

So she found a crew of people who rents indoor pool late at night and borrow a friend's kayak whose size was close to mine so I could try it again.  We had a good evening and for 20$ paddling and swimming was a good way to spend a snowless Saturday night.

So I figured out that eventually, I will need to get a white water kayak, learn to roll properly and gets scared because she ain't !
