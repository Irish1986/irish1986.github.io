### Rejoining the CAC

After my hiatus was over, I rejoined the [Canadian Alpin Club](http://dev.accmontreal.ca/) early this year but I didn't get involved much.  Since we are becoming a family in couple of month, my partner in climb is not going to take huge risk and venture too far in the backcountry this winter.  So I decided to get back in touch with other fun people to ski uphill and explore the backcountry.

### Back in Tremblant

The CAC organize a touring day in Tremblant and about 12 people decided to join us.  It was mostly new comer and first timer yet fit and strong hiker who showed up.  Chantale and myself had [skinned up Tremblant early this year]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2019-11-25-mont-tremblant %}) via the south side and since the organizer was not familiar we eventually became group leaders.

The group was divided in two, Chantale with the front sub-group whom were ~12 min ahead of the second group.  We started via [Nansen](https://www.tremblant.ca/things-to-do/activities/alpine-touring) and finished by Vertigo.  It was my second time hiking up this trails and it was fantastic.  The trails were nice with about 10-15 cm fresh snow from the last few days.

It took our little group about 2hrs 30 minutes to summit and we took a short break at the top since Tremblant offer nice amenities (which are rare while touring).  Short lunch and half the group decided to ski down half of the north side while the rest were happy that going uphill was over.  Chantale was tired and enjoy well earn turns for a fantastic day.
