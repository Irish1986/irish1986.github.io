### Trying out ski touring ?
Ski touring is [gaining a lot of popularity](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/28/travel/skinning-ski-aspen.html) in the past few year.  I came from a mountaineering background and myself jumped into the trends.  Ski lift ticket are expensive and it a great workout.  Although specialized [ski touring gear can be expensive](https://www.cripplecreekbc.com/collections/packages/products/daily-driver-2-0-ski-package) and trying before buying is not a bad idea before spending several thousands.  I highly recommend that you should try ski touring in bound since venturing in the backcountry involve several new layer of challenge include avalanche safety and skiing wild pow.  Also it means you can focus on trying new gear and getting familiar with the basic instead of fearing for your life.

### What to rent and bring?
Without getting into too much details, you need to get the follow for certain.

* Skis with alpine touring (AT) binding
* Skins that fits those ski
* AT Ski Boots compatible with your binding

Obviously your should also bring these things.

* Daypack
* Goggles
* Helmet
* Water and snacks

Since you do not have the skill to go into avalanche terrain you won't need these.  Although if you want to make belief, you can add about 5 extra pound in your daypack since that about the weight you will need to carry uphill if you ever go.

* Transceiver
* Snow shovel
* Probe
* Snow study kit
* Snow saw

### Rental location

* [LaCordée](https://www.lacordee.com/fr/services/location-montreal)

This store used to be Le Yeti before LaCordée bought them couple of years ago.  They still carry a lot of gear and do several demo day.  Pricing is decent  (~60$) for the AT ski or splitboard setup.

* [MEC](https://mecmontreal.pointofrentalcloud.com/portal/category/Ski%20de%20haute%20route/21748)

MEC offer good price if you are just looking for AT boots (~15$) and will borrow AT ski from a friend.  The setup is about 50$ per day.

* [Atmosphere St-Sauveur](https://www.sportsexperts.ca/fr-CA/Magasins?StoreNumber=834&StoreName=atmosphere-factoreries-st-sauveur)

The crew from [VieillesPo](https://www.vieillespo.com/) often organize first timer day and recommend to rent from this store.  I am not certain about the pricing but I am told they also offer telemark gear.

* [Sommets St-Sauveur](https://www.sommets.com/en/ski-mountains/sommet-morin-heights/rate/)

I am told St-Sauveur ski ressort rents AT gear although I am not certain which area (most likely Morin Height or Olympia since only these two allow uphill skiing).  Call them and check what is available.

* [Roc n Ride](https://rocnride.com/location/)

[Last year]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2019-03-10-touring-mont-sauvage %}), not yet partner in climb and I sent ski touring for our third date.  She had forgotten her boots back home and we rented from Roc n Ride.  If you ski in Mont Plante, Alta or the others few ressort that allows uphill skiing around Val David it a great place to rent from.

* [Chalet des Voyageurs](https://www.tremblant.ca/planifiez/location/location-equipement-hiver)

Obviously, you will pay ressort premium and being in Mont Tremblant it gets expensive quickly.  You can not reserve your gear ahead of time either therefore for 75$ per day, get there early so you can maximize your dollar and be certain to have an available setup.  Also you will need to wait the rental line up so expect a minimum of 30 minutes before you can start to ski uphill.  On the plus side, since you rent from the ressort you won't have to pay for multiple day based off a store closing hours far away.

* [Sutton Ski Ressort](https://montsutton.com/en/services/rentals/)

Pricing and is weird where they have a rate for people only renting AT ski and binding and they suggest that you can tour with normal ski boot.  It is not impossible but it make the whole experience a lot less fun.  You should get proper AT boots since they allow proper ankle movement and flex.

* [Ski Bromont](https://www.skibromont.com/en/rental-repairshop)

Another ressort that I have not either skinned up or rented from.  I am told they have some gear, call them.

* [Ski La Reserve](https://skilareserve.com/rates/?lang=en&tab=rentals#tab_location)

This has the best pricing I have found so far, not only they offer a nice location to try for the first time but at for ~35$ package is very interesting.  You can also rent telemark from them.
