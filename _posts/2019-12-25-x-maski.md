### Merry X-Mas everyone ?
We are visting Chantale's uncle cabin in Lanaudiere, after several days indoor eating, drinking and late nights it was time to burn some calories.  So after a hefty breakfast, early X-mas gift exchanging and more eating, we headed up to Ski Montcalm which was about 20 minutes from the cottage.  The trails were open only in after 1PM and would close only couple of hours later.  So we were some of the few braves to ski that day.

### Still early season conditions
Ski Montcalm had four lift open on that day which is reasonable for the size of the ressort but it was a lot for X-Mas.  We did ski every runs open (6 or 8 depending on how you count) and even went up the magic carpet to try the kiddie slope.  Since there were few people we essentially lap the hill over and over especially on the north side that had few nice and fast runs.
