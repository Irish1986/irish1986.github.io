### Evening ski with Mel & Tristan ?
Our friends Melanie and Tristan are back from there southern trip in Mexico.  They went hiking Cotopaxti and did some whitewater kaying in Ecuador some Chantale wanted to know everything that had happen.  We went evening skiing in St-Sauveur with them and that marked our 10th day skiing so far this season.  We drove up pass all the shopping mall outlet and thru some traffic to finally reach St-Saveur ressort around 16:00.  Finally taking the new "BBQ lift" from St-Sauveur, a lift chair with integrated heating that is supposed to warm you up, we were happy to be with our friends.  We went down Avila' side first and did all the runs except the snow park.  Went back on the Cote 68 for a few more runs and finally the girls went back for gossip time.

### Finally some snow ?!?
Tristan and myself continued for several more runs and explore the right side of the ressort to realize that only the farthest lift was open.  Skate skiing and started skiing down diamond runs that weren't bad given the snow quality.  About 90%+ of the snow in St-Sauveur is man made right now and it feels like it.  Ice patch and tough snow pack everywhere.  We rejoined with our girlfriends and Mathieu, a friendly kayaker known by everyone but me.  Several more runs and we ended up playing card game inside before leaving around 10PM.  Another on in the book !
