### Enough already with the X-Mas parties !!!
We spent lots of time over the holiday with friends and family, drank and ate a lot.  Even if we were able to sneak out a bit, the early winter condition had been not that great either so we really hope the start of the year would be being some time outside for us.

### With Tristan and Mel once again
We skied with [Tristan and Mel ]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2019-12-26-boxing-day-evening %}) on boxing day and they decided they would be joining us in Quebec city.  Our wish for big pow day did not successfully materialized and condition were still fairly minimal.  About half of the runs were open and the other half still icy.

Tristan and I got to do a few ungroomed runs while the girls skied other pitches around.  It was great to be in muggles and a real leg burner.

### Airbnb time
Reserve a [cool airbnb](https://www.airbnb.ca/rooms/14870307?source_impression_id=p3_1580143779_Q8dets1tTUr1R3TT) in Quebec City.  It was a nice little studio which I would recommend to anyone looking for a calm and very affordable place in QC.  Plus our host, Anne-Marie, was super great !
