### Nordic Skiing
One of my many X-mas gift were a pair of nordic skis which I never had done before.  We drove to [Sentiers du Moulin](https://sentiersdumoulin.com/) which had several dozen of trails opened and groomed for classic nordic skiing.  I had heard of this place for mountain biking but I could not believe how well organize it was.  The accommodations are beyond believes and everything is build to make the experience enjoyable.

### Sick as a dog
I have been sick for several days, I got the flu from Chantale who got it for her niece over the X-mas.  I had been hard on her since she is pregnant but I can tell you it is hard on me too.  I wasn't certain the day before if I would be able to ski and that morning I felt like crap.

My plan was to spend all my energy in the morning and later die in the afternoon.  The ski track was really really nice, Chantale is such a good nordic skier and she taught us how to be proficient at it.  Mel and Tristan followed us today again and she were able to loop for 4.5km before turning around.  I loved it and will go nordic skiing again but for that day I was done.
