### Meeting with Mylene
Mylene is a friend of Chantale, I had met her briefly once last year when Chantale and her skied together for a weekend not long after we started to date.  They both had done a lot of kayaking and skiing together and I was told she was a good skier.  We left from Place Longueuil around 16:00 and drove almost no-stop to Quebec city for a quick errands.  After all that road, we stopped at [Ashton](https://chezashton.ca/) for a quick Quebec City.  It was very disappointing...

We used the same rental as [last year]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2019-03-22-quebec-bound %}) called [la Maison du Postier](https://www.booking.com/hotel/ca/la-maison-du-postier.fr.html) in Berthier-sur-Mer.  It a great little cottage that also serve as the village post office.  Andthis is one of the first trip we did as a couple therefore it is a special place for us.

### Big Saturday
One thing we have been working hard on is not to get stressed and pressure ourselves at getting out there.  We were in the past overzealous and often rushed to get out which often meant pressure crappy morning routine.  We showed up at the Massif du Sud a little bit before 10 AM.

We went for couple of groomed runs, followed by natural conditions and went glades skiing after.  Around that time, Chantale was getting tire so she took a quick break which Mylene used to push me out of my comfort zone.  We [skiied in the extreme zone](http://massifdusud.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Carte-des-pistes-au-bon-format1.jpg) and I got away with my first double black diamond run !!!  We regrouped for couple more runs together and called it the day.  I was toasted and had to nap before losing another cribbage game.
