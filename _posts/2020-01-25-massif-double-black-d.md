### Even bigger Sunday !!!
The expected pow did not felt as much as expected although the conditions were softer with heavy wet snow.  I had heavy legs on the first few runs but after that I got my rhythmed back and was ready for a big one.  The girls elected for an early break and Mylene switched ski for fatter and more playful twin tips instead of her carving setup.

### Time to get serious
We visited glades once again for couple of runs and Chantale was very tired. Mylene convinced me to visit the extreme zone once again for more double black diamond pitches.

We went to far down and had to climb up couple of meters since the stream has not full froze this year and condition are still very minimal.  Once we got out of there, we regroup with Chantale who called it day since this was her last run of the weekend.  Overall I skied 3 double black diamond which was a huge step for me since last year I could barely do intermediary glades or moggles.  I am getting good at this :)

### Back home !
We left St-Philemon around 15:15 on Sunday and had about 3h30 drive in front of us.  The weather was not great and Chantale insisted to take the first driving shift.  Road condition and a bit of slusshy snow made the whole thing harder that we wished but after 2 hours driving we stopped for a well deserved pouting at Lemaire.

After a proper carb-loading session, we drove back to Longueuil and dropped off Mylene.  Overall this trips was great and I can not say enough good things about Massif du Sud.  It is a must do for any weekend warrior or ski bums !
