I am Simon, an aerospace engineer, working in Montr√©al, QC, Canada.

I have started rock climbing about a decade ago and moved into so many other mountain and outdoor sports.  Eventually, I have met Chantale, my *partner in climb*, via [RencontreSportive](https://www.rencontresportive.com/) and she became my favorite human in the whole world ever since.  Also, I have a big German Shepherd Dog named Boo.  He sheds and stinks a lot but what can you do.

## Tick List
* TBD, i have done so many
