### Getting Started

[Getting Started]({{ site.github.url }}{% post_url 2015-10-10-getting-started %}): getting started with installing Lagrange, whether you are completely new to using Jekyll, or simply just migrating to a new Jekyll theme.

### About this theme

Lagrange is a minimalist Jekyll theme. The purpose of this theme is to provide a simple, clean, content-focused blogging platform for your personal site or blog. Below you can find everything you need to get started.

I modded a theme I found [here](https://github.com/lenpaul/lagrange).  Feel free to fork the original and start your own Github.io page, it free and works well.

This theme is completely free and open source software. You may use it however you want, as it is distributed under the [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).
